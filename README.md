# ⚽ Machine Learning Analysis of Player Statistics

## 📊 Overview

This project leverages **machine learning** and **data visualization** techniques to analyze and compare the performance of football players across the **top 5 European leagues**: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1.

The goal is to assist **football scouts and analysts** in identifying top-performing players through advanced statistical insights and predictive modeling.

## 👨‍💻 Team

- **Mohamed Amr** – Artificial Intelligence
- **Abdulrahman Taha** – Computer Engineering
- **Khaled Zakria Mohamed Hamed** – Artificial Intelligence
- **Abdallah Saad** – Communication Engineering

## 🎯 Mission

> To simplify and empower the scouting process by providing intuitive, data-driven insights into player performance using machine learning models and Power BI visualizations.

## 🔍 Data Workflow

### 1. 🧼 Data Cleaning
- Removed inaccuracies and missing values
- Ensured consistency in metrics like goals, assists, xG, xA, etc.

### 2. 📈 Data Exploration
- Analyzed league-wide trends (e.g., goal distribution, player positions, age breakdown)
- Visualized stats by age, nationality, position, and disciplinary records (yellow/red cards)

### 3. 📊 Data Visualization
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards
- Showcased:
  - Top players in each league
  - Goal/Assist breakdowns
  - Player comparisons by position
  - Predictions for breakout seasons

### 4. 🤖 Machine Learning Models

#### Classification:
- **Random Forest** (Best Accuracy)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Neural Networks

#### Regression:
- **Linear Regression** (Best MSE and R² Score)
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

Used to predict:
- Total score
- Goal/assist potential
- Player value indicators

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Data processing, ML)
- **Power BI** (Visualization)
- **Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 📌 Key Features

- Interactive stats dashboard for all players
- League-wise player performance comparisons
- ML-driven predictions for scouting
- Easy selection and comparison by player or position
